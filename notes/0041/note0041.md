# Leetcode [41. First Missing Positive](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/)
- Type: Array
- Approach:
	- This is an index hash problem. Because we want the smallest missing positive integer in an unsorted integer array, we have to check whether the value of number n in index i is equal to i+1, which is n ?== i+1.
	- Then, for each number in index i, if nums[nums[i]-1] != nums[i], we swap these two number until we follow the rule of nums[nums[i]-1] == nums[i].
	- Use another for loop to check whether the value of number n in index i is equal to i+1.
	- Last but not least, if all number follow the rule, return len(nums)+1. 
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)
