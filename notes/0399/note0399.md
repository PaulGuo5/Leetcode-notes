# Leetcode [399. Evaluate Division](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/)
- Type: Graph (dfs)
- Approach:
	- We know the equations and corresponding values so that we can build a directed graph to store the division value of two number.
	- As for a given unknown equation, we can use dfs to search the equation exists or not.
	- The dfs is bottom-up method and if the division value of two number exists, we return the value, otherwise, we return None.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(V+E)
	- Space: O(n)
