# Leetcode 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
- Type: dynamic programming ï¼ˆSequence type)
- Approach:
	1. 5 phases in total: 
		- Phase 1: No stock
		- Phase 2: Holding One stock (first)
		- Phase 3: No stock and seld one stock
		- Phase 4: Holding one stock (second)
		- Phase 5: No stock and seld two stocks
	2. DP state transfer equation:
		- dp[i][j]: In first ith day of phase j maximum profits
		- For phase 1,3,5:
			1. The phase of first i-1 is the same as first i', which means we still don't have any stock:
				- tmp1 = dp[i-1][j]
			2. The phase of first i-1 is different from first i', which means we sell the stock in the i-1's day:
				- tmp2 = dp[i-1][j-1]+price[i-1]-price[i-2]
			3. dp[i][j] = max(tmp1, tmp2)
		- For phase 2, 4:
			1. The phase of first i-1 is different from first i', which means that we just buy a stock on day i-1:
				- tmp1 = dp[i-1][j-1]
			2. Otherwise:
				- tmp2 = dp[i-1][j]+price[i-1]-price[i-2]
			3. dp[i][j] = max(tmp1, tmp2)
	3. Boundary and results:
		- Init: dp[i][j] = -float('inf'); dp[0][1] = 0
		- Result: maximum of dp[-1][1], dp[-1][5], dp[-1][5]
	4. Complexity:
		- Time: O(n*5)
		- Space: O(n)
