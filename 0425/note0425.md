# Leetcode [425. Word Squares](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-squares/)
- Type: Trie + Search (bfs)
- Approach:
	1. Approach 1:
		- Only use bfs searching.
		- Build a table to store all prefix words. For example, in the ["lead","lady"] words array, we build a table which is {"l":{"lead","lady"}, "le":{"lead"}, "lea":{"lead"}, "lead":{"lead"}, "la":{"lady"}, "lad":{"lady"}, "lady":{"lady"}}. For this, we can quickly retrieve a prefix word in table in O(1).
		- Begin from each word, use bfs to search results. Append next prefix if row[i] == col[i] in array.
	2. Approach 2:
		- Similar as approach 1, but use trie to store prefix words instead of a table.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
