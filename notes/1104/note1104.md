# Leetcode [1104. Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-in-zigzag-labelled-binary-tree/)
- Type: Binary tree
- Approach:
	1. You can easily determine the parent by dividing by 2 with a normally ordered (non-zigzag) binary tree
For example the parent of 9 can be calculated via int(9/2) which is 4
	2. So we now how to trace from the input label to the root node. So lets start with label In our example, we will use 14. To determine the parent of 14, notice that in the same spot in a normally ordered binary tree that it is 9. So you just need to calculate how to get from 14 to 9.
	3. inversion formula: (max number of current level + min number of current level) - current number
	For example to find the inversion of 14: 15 + 8 - 14 = 9
	From here you just divide 9 by 2 to find the parent 4
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(logn)
	- Space: O(n)
