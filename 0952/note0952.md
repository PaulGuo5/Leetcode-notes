# Leetcode [952. Largest Component Size by Common Factor](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-component-size-by-common-factor/)
- Type: Graph (union find)
- Approach:
	- Basic union find approach and function.
	- The tricky part in the problem is that we can union all components of the number and the number itself by enumerating from 2 to the square of the number.
	- When enumerate from 2 to the square of the number, don't forget to union the division of the number to the current enumerating number, by which we can save time.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
