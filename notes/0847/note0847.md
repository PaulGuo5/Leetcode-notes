# Leetcode [847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-visiting-all-nodes/)
- Type: BFS
- Approach:
	1. The most tricky part to solve the problem is to find a way to represent a unique state for a node.
	2. We can use (cur_node, visited_nodes) to represent it.
	3. Use a bit int to represent the visited nodes. For instance, 0, 2, 3 were visited, so it's 1011.
	4. And our goal is to find the steps when the visited_nodes == 1111 if length of the nodes is 4.
	5. Init: push all the nodes to a queue, (node, 1 <<-- node);
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(nx2^n)
	- Space: O(nx2^n)
