# Leetcode [1289. Minimum Falling Path Sum II
](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum-ii/)
- Type: Dynamic programming
- Approach:
	- The problem is like house painting problem.
	- dp[i][j] means the minimum sum of falling path in arr[i][j].
	- As for a position dp[i][j], dp[i][j] is equal to smallest number in dp[i-1] except dp[i-1][j] plus arr[i][j].
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n^2)
	- Space: O(1)
