# Leetcode [1574. Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-to-be-removed-to-make-array-sorted/)
- Type: Two pointers
- Approach:
	- Find the right most j such that arr[j – 1] > arr[j], if not found which means the entire array is sorted return 0. Then we have a non-descending subarray arr[j~n-1].
	- We maintain two pointers i, j, such that arr[0~i] is non-descending and arr[i] <= arr[j] which means we can remove arr[i+1~j-1] to get a non-descending array. Number of elements to remove is j – i – 1.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)
