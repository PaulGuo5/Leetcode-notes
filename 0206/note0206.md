##  Thoughts

###  Dummy node
1.  Create a dummy node
2.  Create a tail point to the head
3.  create a tmp node as head.next 
4.  Make head points to tmp.next
5.  Make tmp points to tail.next
6.  Make tmp as tail
7.  Make tail points to tmp

###  Without dummy node
1.  Make tail as head
2.  Make cur as head.next
3.  The similar idea as Dummy node
