# Leetcode 968. Binary Tree Cameras
- Type: Binary Tree
- Approach:
	- Bfs + button up
	- A node will have 3 states in total:
		1. Leaf
		2. A parent of a leaf(s)
		3. Node
	- Recursion:
		1. Return 0 if node is a leaf
		2. Return 1 if node is a parent of a leaf(s), with a camera
		3. Return 2 if node is covered, without a camera

- Boundary and results:
	- dfs(root) == 0 means there is only one node in the tree, then return 1
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)
