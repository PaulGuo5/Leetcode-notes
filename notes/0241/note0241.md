- Type: Divide and conquer
- Approach:
	- For each operation, we can split the input string as two number lists, as left and right.
	- Traverse the numbers in left and right and add the current result to our result list.
	- Memo can also be used to store the current result for saving the time complexity.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n^3)
	- Space: O(n)
