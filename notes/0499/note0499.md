# Leetcode [499. The Maze III](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze-iii/)
- Type: Search (bfs)
- Approach:
	- Similar to the problem [505. The Maze II](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze-ii/)
	1. bfs:
		- Instead of queue, use heap to pop minimum steps with its stop postion each time
		- Record every direction in the heap
		- Return value sorted by steps and lexicographically path
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(mn x max(m,n))
	- Space: O(mn)
