##  Thoughts

###  Stupid thought
1.  Traverse the entire linklist and store the values in a array list
2.  Create a dictionary to count every element of array list
3.  Create a new link list with each element satisfies the condition

###  Better thought
1.  Operate in the origin linklist
2.  Use a dummy node and a current node to link to the head of linklist
3.  Use a flag which is initialized as 0, which turns to 1 if the values of cur.next and cur.next.next are the same. And then make cur.next points to cur.next.next.
4.  Iterate step 3 untill cur.next.val is not equal to cur.next.next.val
5.  If flag is True, cur.next points to cur.next.next; Or make cur.next as cur
because we should store the cur.val in the linklist
