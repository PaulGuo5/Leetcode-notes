# Leetcode (979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree)[https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/]
- Type: binary tree
- Approach:
	- dfs + bottom-up
	- For each node, return cur_node.val+left+right-1, for we have totally cur_node.val+left+right coins at the current node, we need to do (total coins - 1) numbers of operations to distribute coins; as for result, we accumulatively add abs(left)+abs(right) to the result.
- Boundary and results:
	- If not node, return 0
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)
