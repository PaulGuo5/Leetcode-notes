# Leetcode [775. Global and Local Inversions](https://leetcode.com/problems/global-and-local-inversions/)
- Type: Math
- Approach:
	1. The numbers are [0, 1, 2, ..., N-1], if we initially put the numbers by there values as index, we can get a sorted array. When we change a number i from index i to index larger than i+1, which is j, there must be a number j is larger than i and their distance is larger than 1, which means the new array has a global inversion.
	2. Thus, check each number and its index and find the difference of them.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)
