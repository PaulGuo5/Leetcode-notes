# Leetcode [163. Missing Ranges](hhttps://leetcode.com/problems/missing-ranges/)
- Type: Array
- Approach:
	1. Set a variable as previous value, which starts from low-1.
	2. Set a variable as current value, which is the number in the array.
	3. If current - previous >= 2, which means they are not continous, we add (pre+1 -> current-1) to our answer.
	4. As for the boundary, we should also check the upper bound and imagine that upper+1 is in our array, so that we would not miss values.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
