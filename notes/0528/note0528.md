# Leetcode [528. Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/)
- Type: Math, random, binary search
- Approach:
	1. Use the prefix sum method to add each weight.
	2. Use ramdon() function to get a random weight from 1 to sum of all weights, that's the index we want to find.
	2. Implement binary search to find the index in the prefix sum array.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(nlogn)
	- Space: O(n)
