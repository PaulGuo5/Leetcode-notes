# Leetcode [1217. Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-move-chips-to-the-same-position/)
- Type: Array, math
- Approach:
	1. We can group the chips by checking whether its position index is odd or even, and count the number separately.
	2. Return the less number of groups, because we can have the same cost with the same parity.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)
