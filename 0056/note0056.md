##  Thoughts

###  Thought 1
1.  Create a new list to store the node in intervals, in which, [x, 0] means x is the start of a interval and [x, 1] means x is the end of the interval
2.  Sort the created list
3.  Traverse the list and put the value into a new stack if it is the start; if it is the end, pop the stack as start, and if now there is nothing in the stack, add this [start, node] to our result

###  Though 2
1.  Sort the intervals
2.  Compare the end of a interval and the next start of a interval
3.  If it is larger than the next one, add the large one to our result
