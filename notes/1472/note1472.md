# Leetcode [1472. Design Browser History](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-browser-history/)
- Type: Design, stack
- Approach:
	1. Use a stack to store url ,a pointer cur to store the current index of url, and a pointer top to store the furthest distance from current url.
	2. Ininially set cur and top as 0;
	3. When visiting a new url, set cur++ and top = cur because we want to limit the forward method by top.
	4. When using backward function, before return history[cur], we need to compare the value of 0 and cur-steps and set cur as the smaller one.
	5. Forward function is the similar method as backward function.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(1)
	- Space: O(n)
