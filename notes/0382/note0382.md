# Leetcode [382. Linked List Random Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-random-node/)
- Type: Linklist, random
- Approach:
	1. Using *Reservoir Sampling* method to solve the problem.
	2. For a linklist with n elements, we have 1/m possibility to choose the mth element, and (1-m)/m possibility not to choose it. Thus, for each element, it is be choosen by a possibility of 1/n.
	3. Proven: p(m) = 1/m x (m/(m+1) x (m+1)/(m+2) x ... x (n-2)/(n-1) x (n-1)/n) = 1/n.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)
