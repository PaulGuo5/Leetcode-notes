# Leetcode [239. Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)
- Type: Array, monotonic deque
- Approach:
	1. Create a monotonic deque (from large to small), because it can access data like queue and stack in cpp.
	2. Before push a new data to the deque, pop all the elements smaller than it.
	3. Deque.front() is the largest data.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
