##  Thoughts

###  If two linked lists have intersection, we can find two observations:
###  They must have same nodes after the intersection point.
###  L1 = 1,2,3
###  L2 = 6,5,2,3
###  L1+L2 = 1,2,3,6,5,2,3
###  L2+L1 = 6,5,2,3,1,2,3

1.  To implement L1+L2 as well as L2+L1, we can simply jump to another list's head
after traveling through certain list.
2.  But, you need to notice that if the two lists have no intersection at all,
3.  you should stop after you've already checked L1+L2, so we need a flag jumpToNext to ensure we only traverse L1 + L2 once.
