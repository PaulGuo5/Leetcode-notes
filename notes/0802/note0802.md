# Leetcode [802. Find Eventual Safe States](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/)
- Type: Graph (topological sorting)
- Approach:
	- Build a directed graph as reversed given graph and store indegree for each node.
	- Find the cycle by topological sorting and return nodes with 0 indegree after topological sorting
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
