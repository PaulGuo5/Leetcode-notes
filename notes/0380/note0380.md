# Leetcode [380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/)
- Type: Hash table
- Approach:
	1. Use a array list to store all the numbers, and a hash table to store the number and its corresponding index in the array list.
	2. It's easier to implement in insert function and getRandom function by using O(1) time complexity.
	3. As for the delete function, if we delete a number by the index, the time complexity will be O(n). However, if we use pop_back(), then the time complexity is O(1).
	4. Then, we can swap the numbers between the index of the deleting number and the last index.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(1)
	- Space: O(n)
