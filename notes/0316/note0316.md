# Leetcode [316. Remove Duplicate Letters](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/)
- Type: String (greedy)
- Approach:
	1. last_index is a mapping from character to its last appearing index cur_result stores current result

	2. When cur_result is not empty, cur_result[-1] represents the last element of current result, if the current character ch is smaller than cur_result[-1] and we have another cur_result[-1] in the subsequent string i.e. i < last_index[cur_result[-1]], we need to pop the last element from the current result.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
