# Leetcode [334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/)
- Type: Array
- Approach:
	1. Use 2 variables to seperately represent the currently smallest number (c1) and the second smallest number (c2).
	2. If a current number is less than c1, set c1 to the number; if a current number if larger than c1 and smaller than c2, set c2 as the number; otherwise, we know the the array has that pattern because the number is larger than 2 numbers before it increasingly.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)
