# Leetcode [189. Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)
- Type: Array
- Approach:
	1. Mode the k value by the length of the array in case k is larger than the length of the array.
	2. Write a helper function to reverse the array from index start to index end, which can be solved by 2 pointers and cost O(n) time complexity.
	3. Do 3 reverse:
		1. Reverse array from index 0 to n-k-1 (n is the length of the array). 
		2. Reverse array from index n-k to n-1.
		3. Reverse the entile array.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)
