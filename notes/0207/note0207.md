# Leetcode [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)
- Type: Graph (topology sorting)
- Approach:
	- Use topology sorting to find whether the graph have cycle.
	- We build a graph for prerequisite as key and the corresponding course as values. Now we can use topology sorting to check whether the graph have cycle.
	- If the graph have cycle, there is no node in the graph with indegree is 0.
	- Thus, we need to store the node which have 0 indegree in advance.
	- After that, use a deque to pop all children nodes for a node with 0 indegree. Whenever we get a new node with 0 indegree, we add count as 1 and minus the indegree of the child node as 1. If the current indegree of the child is 0, we can add it to the deque and check its children nodes.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
