# Leetcode [1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/pseudo-palindromic-paths-in-a-binary-tree/)
- Type: Binary tree
- Approach:
	1. Use bfs method to traverse the tree and record the path.
	2. Everytime it comes to a leaf, check whether the path is palindromic or not.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(h)
