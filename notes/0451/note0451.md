# Leetcode [451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)
- Type: Hash map, sort
- Approach:
	- As for cpp:
		- Method1: use an unordered_map to count the frequency of the characters; use a map to sort the value of the frequency and responding characters; return the string by adding string in map in reversed order.
		- Method2: use an unordered_map to count the frequency of the characters; use lambda sort to sort the original string by yhe frequency.
	- As for Python: use collections.Counter to count the frequency of characters and use sort to sort the Counter as decreasing order.
- Complexity:
	- Time: Method1: O(n); Method2: O(nlogn)
	- Space: O(n)
