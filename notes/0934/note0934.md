# Leetcode [934. Shortest Bridge](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-bridge/)
- Type: Search, dfs+bfs
- Approach:
	1. Use dfs to find one of the island. Mark the visited cell to -1;
	2. Use bfs to find another island; store all cells of island which has been found to a queue and use a variable to store steps. Mark the visited cell to -1. When we get a cell valued 1, return the steps.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
