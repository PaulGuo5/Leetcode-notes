# Leetcode [1490. Clone N-ary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-n-ary-tree/)
- Type: Search (bfs/dfs) / clone
- Approach:
	- Similar to the problems:
		1. [133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)
		2. [1485. Clone Binary Tree With Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-binary-tree-with-random-pointer/)
		3. [138. Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)
	1. bfs:
		- Use a dictionary to store each new node, key is original node and values are value and children new node.
		- Use a deque to store and retrieve each node.
	2. dfs:
		- Very basic dfs method, it's a bottom-up approach.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
