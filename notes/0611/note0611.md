# Leetcode [611. Valid Triangle Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-triangle-number/)
- Type: Array, 2 pointers
- Approach:
	1. The strategy to solve the problem is very similar to the problem 3 SUM. 
	2. For lengths a, b, c to make a valid triangle: a <= b <= c, then a+b > c.
	3. Thus, for a largest c, we use 2 pointers to find valid a and b. The problem is transfered as 3 SUM.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n^2)
	- Space: O(n)
