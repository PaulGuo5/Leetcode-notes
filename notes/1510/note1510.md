# Leetcode [1510. Stone Game IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iv/)
- Type: Dynamic programming
- Approach:
	1. Dp[i] means whether Alice will win if there are i stones in a pile.
	2. Assume that there is a k, whose square (k**2) is less than i. If dp[i-k**2] is False, means there is an opportunity that dp[i] can win, so just set dp[i] to True.
	3. Inialize all value in dp as False, and dp[0] is also False because Alice is the first player. 
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
