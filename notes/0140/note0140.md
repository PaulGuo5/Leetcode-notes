# Leetcode [140. Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/)
- Type: Dp, dfs
- Approach:
	1. Base on [139. Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/), we can know for an index of char in the string s, all the indexes before which can combine as a word in dict can be known.
	2. Then, we can build a graph, which can bond all indexes which can be combined as a valid word in dict.
	3. Use dfs to traverse.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
