# Leetcode [497. Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-point-in-non-overlapping-rectangles/)
- Type: Math (random) + binary search
- Approach:
	- Similar to the problem [528. Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/)
	1. Init function:
		- Use prefix sum to store the area of each rectangle
	2. Pick function:
		- Find a random area from 1 to the total area
		- Use binary search to search a specific area according to the random area
		- Calculate the coordinates by the area
- Complexity:
	- Time:
		1. Init:
			- O(n)
		2. Pick:
			- O(logn)
	- Space: O(n)
