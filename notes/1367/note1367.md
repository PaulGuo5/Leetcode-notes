# Leetcode [1367. Linked List in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-in-binary-tree/)
- Type: Binary tree (dfs)
- Approach:
	1. Use basic dfs traverse for a binary tree to solve the problem.
	2. For a node in the tree, use dfs to search for the values in the linklist.
	3. When the linklist points to null, it means we find the value.
	4. Otherwise, if the tree node is null, it means we can't find in this path.
	5. Back to the main function, not only use dfs from the root, but also we use dfs from root.left and root.right, and so on until we find the answer.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
