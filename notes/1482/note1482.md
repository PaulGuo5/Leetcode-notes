# Leetcode [1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-of-two-numbers-in-an-array/)
- Type: Binary search
- Approach:
	1. If m * k > n, it impossible, so return -1.
	2. Otherwise, it's possible, we can binary search the result.
	3. Left = 1 is the smallest days, right = max(A) is surely big enough to get m bouquests.
	4. If bouq < m, mid is still small for m bouquest, so we turn left = mid + 1. If bouq >= m, mid is big enough for m bouquest, so we turn right = mid.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(Nlog(maxA))
	- Space: O(1)
