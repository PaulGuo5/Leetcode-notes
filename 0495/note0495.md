# Leetcode [495. Teemo Attacking](https://leetcode.com/problems/teemo-attacking/)
- Type: Array (intervals)
- Approach:
	- All we need to do is to merge some intervals with equal length and return total length of merged intervals. Note also that intervals are already sorted by its beginings (and ends as well, because they have equal length), so usual sorting step can be skipped.
	- All we need to do is to traverse our timeSeries and check if difference between current point and previous is more than duration. If it is more, we add duration to total sum, if it is less, we add difference between current and previous elements. Also we need to deal with border case of empty array and if array is not empty, add duration in the end.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)
