# Leetcode [1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor/)
- Type: Binary search tree, dfs, bottom-up
- Approach:
	1. We can use bottom-up dfs method to solve the problem.
	2. As for a node, we can calculate the largest value and smallest value from the root to the current node, ans store them as variables in dfs function.
	3. Assume that we have already known the results of the left children and right children as left and right, and then we choose a larger result between left and right.
	4. As for the corner case, if the node is null, we return the difference between largest value from the node and smallest value from the node.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
