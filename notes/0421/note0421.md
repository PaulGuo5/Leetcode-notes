# Leetcode [421. Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-of-two-numbers-in-an-array/)
- Type: Trie
- Approach:
	1. Scan the array nums and build a trie tree by each binary digit of each num.
	2. Scan the array nums, for each number, find the XOR of each binary digit, which means find the value of sub tree is 1 when the binary digit is 0.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
