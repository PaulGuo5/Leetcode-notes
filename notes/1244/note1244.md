# Leetcode [1244. Design A Leaderboard](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-a-leaderboard/)
- Type: Hash table, hash set
- Approach:
	1. Use a hash table to store the playerid as key and score as value. And every time add a score to an existing playerid, add the new score to the old score.
	2. Use a hash set to store the {score, playerid} pair. Because set in CPP is an ordered set, we can sort the set by scores increasing or decreasing when we add a new score. As for adding a new score, if the playerId is in the hash table, we should delete the {score, playerid} pair in set to avoid duplicated playId in the set before we put the new pair into the set.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(logn)
	- Space: O(n)
