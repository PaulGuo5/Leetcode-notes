# Leetcode [366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-leaves-of-binary-tree/)
- Type: Binary tree (bottom-up)
- Approach:
	- The problem can be considered as find the height of each node.
	- Thus, use bottom-up method to caculate each node height, which is max(left_height, right_height)+1
	- Base case is when node is None, return 0.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
