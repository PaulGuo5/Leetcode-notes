# Leetcode [117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/)
- Type: Binary tree, bfs
- Approach:
	1. Use basic bfs level traversal binary search to solve the problem.
	2. For each level, set a pre pointer to record the previous node of the same level.
	3. By this, we can point the pre pointer to the current node.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
