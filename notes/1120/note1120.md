# Leetcode [1120. Maximum Average Subtree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subtree/)
- Type: Binary tree (dfs)
- Approach:
	- Bottom-up dfs approach.
	- For a node, assume that its sum of descendants and number of descendants already know, we can calculate the current sum (left_cum+right_cum) and number of nodes (left_cnt+right_cnt) by adding current nodes. Update the global max_res by comparing the max_res and sum of its values (left_cum+right_cum+node.val) divided by the number of nodes (left_cnt+right_cnt+1) including the current node itself. Return (left_cum+right_cum+node.val), (left_cnt+right_cnt+1) for each node.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
