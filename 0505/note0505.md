# Leetcode [505. The Maze II](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze-ii/)
- Type: Search (dfs/bfs)
- Approach:
	- Similar to the problem [490. The Maze](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze/)
	1. bfs:
		- Instead of queue, use heap to pop minimum steps with its stop postion each time
	2. dfs:
		- Top-down dfs approach
		- Remember to remove visited stop position every time
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(mn x max(m,n))
	- Space: O(mn)
