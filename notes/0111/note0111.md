# Leetcode [111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)
- Type: Binary tree (bfs)
- Approach:
	1. We can use bfs to traverse the binary tree, and use a variable height to store the height of the current node.
	2. When the node is a leaf, which means it doesn't have any child, update the res.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
