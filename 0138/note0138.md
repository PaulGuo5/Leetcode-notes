# Leetcode [138. Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)
- Type: Search bfs / clone
- Approach:
	- Similar to the problems:
		1. [133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)
		2. [1485. Clone Binary Tree With Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-binary-tree-with-random-pointer/)
		3. [1490. Clone N-ary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-n-ary-tree/)
	1. bfs:
		- Use a dictionary to store each new node, key is original node and values are value and children new node.
		- Use a deque to store and retrieve each node.
	2. Brute force:
		- 2 round traverse:
			1. Create new nodes to recode the value of nodes in dictionary.
			2. Build relationship of next and random by finding the corresponding key.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
