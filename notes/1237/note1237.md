# Leetcode [1237. Find Positive Integer Solution for a Given Equation](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-positive-integer-solution-for-a-given-equation/)
- Type: Two pointers
- Approach:
	- Set two pointers as 0 and max value, if the value of function equal to z, add 2 pointers to the result; if the value of function larger than z, shrink the value of bigger pointer; otherwise, make the value of smaller pointer larger.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
