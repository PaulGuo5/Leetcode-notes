# Leetcode [1129. Shortest Path with Alternating Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-with-alternating-colors/)
- Type: Graph, bfs
- Approach:
	1. The tricky part of the problem is that the color alternates along the path. 
	2. Thus, we can build two directed graph to represent the 2 colored path.
	3. Also, as for the visited hash set, create 2 hash set to represent the 2 different visited colored nodes.
	4. In c++, remember to use & (reference) to save the space.
	5. Iniatially, the queue has two values, which are {0, 1}, {0, -1}. 0 represents the node, 1 or -1 represents the color (red or blue), because we can start from either red or blue.
	6. Use basic bfs method the solve the rest of the problems.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
