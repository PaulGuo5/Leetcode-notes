# Leetcode [74. Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)
- Type: Binary search
- Approach:
	1. We can transform the question from 2D to 1D because each row is non-decreasing and former rows are smaller than current rows.
	2. The coordinate of mid value is [mid//n, mid%n].
	3. Use basic binary search method to find the target value.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(nlogn)
	- Space: O(1)
