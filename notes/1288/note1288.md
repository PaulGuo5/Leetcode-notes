# Leetcode [1288. Remove Covered Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-covered-intervals/)
- Type: Search (bfs)
- Approach:
	- Sort intervals by increasing of startTime and decreasing of endTime
	- last = -1: last is the farest end time of browsed intervals
	- For each interval in intervals: if interval.endTime <= last, means interval is overlapped then we count removed else last = interval.endTime
	- Result = number of intervals - removed
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(nlog(n))
	- Space: O(1)
