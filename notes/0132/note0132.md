# Leetcode [132. Palindrome Partitioning II](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii/)
- Type: Dynamic programming (partition)
- Approach:
	- Partition type of dynamic programming.
	- As for "aab", if we have already known that "aa" is a palindrome, we just need to check whether b is a palindrome or not.
	- Steps:
		1. Make sure statement by the last step to transfer the one problem to sub problems: 
			- dp[i]: the least number of palindrome substrings in the first ith characters.
			- dp[i] = dp[j]+1 (if s[j:i] is a palindrome).
		2. Init situation and boundary:
			- Set the length of dp is len(s)+1 because we need first ith characters.
			- dp[0] = 0, because null string has no palindrome and set.
			- Return dp[-1]-1, because we need the cut of partitioning instead of parts.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n^2)
	- Space: O(n)
