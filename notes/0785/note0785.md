# Leetcode [785. Is Graph Bipartite?](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/)
- Type: Graph, bfs, bipartition, graph coloring
- Approach:
    1. For each node, if has not been colored, color it to RED(1). Color its neighbors with a different color RED(1) to BLUE(-1) or BLUE(-1) to RED(-1).
    2. If we can finish the coloring then the graph is bipartite. All red nodes on the left no connections between them and all blues nodes on the right, again no connections between them. red and blue nodes are neighbors.
- Complexity:
    - Time: O(V+E)
    - Space: O(V)
