##  Thoughts

###  Stupid thought
1.  Create a set to store the traversed node
2.  Return the node which is in the set

###  Better thought
1.  Fast and slow pointers
2.  If fast pointer equals to slow pointer, set a new iteration from the head which is one move a time and fast pointer is made one move a time
3.  The next time they meet is the cycle begins
