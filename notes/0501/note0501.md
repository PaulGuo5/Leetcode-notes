# Leetcode [501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/)
- Type: Binary search tree
- Approach:
	1. Basically, use inorder traversal to solve the problem.
	2. Use a temporary count to store the current same value when traversing by inorder, and a maximum count to store the current largest mode. Also, an ans array to store the result.
	3. Use a variable pre to store the previous node value. If the current value is equal to the pre, then add count as 1; otherwise, set count to 1 and pre as current value.
	4. If the current count is larger than the maximum count, clear the ans and make the current count as maximum count. 
	5. If the current count is equal to the maximum count, add the current value to the ans.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)
