# Sum of Two Integers
> [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)

## Question
Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.
```bash
Example 1:

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3


Example 2:

Input: a = -2, b = 3
Output: 1
```

## Idea
1. Use ^ to add without carrying
2. Use & to find the carrying bit

```bash
Example1:
0101(a) + 0101(b)

a ^ b = 0101
a & b = 0000
(a & b) << 1 = 0000

Example2:
0010(a) + 0110(b)

a ^ b = 0100
a & b = 0010
(a & b) << 1 = 0100

a = a ^ b = 0100
b = (a & b) << 1 = 0100
a ^ b = 0000
a & b = 0100
(a & b) << 1 = 1000

a = a ^ b = 0000
b = (a & b) << 1 = 1000
a ^ b = 1000
a & b = 0000
(a & b) << 1 = 0000 #done!!!
