# Leetcode [1007. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-domino-rotations-for-equal-row/)
- Type: Array (greedy)
- Approach:
	1. Try make A[0] in a whole row, the condition is that A[i] == A[0] || B[i] == A[0], a and b are the number of swap to make a whole row A[0].
	2. Try B[0], the condition is that A[i] == B[0] || B[i] == B[0], a and b are the number of swap to make a whole row B[0].
	3. Return -1.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)
