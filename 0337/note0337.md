# Leetcode (337. House Robber III)[https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/]
- Type: Binary tree
- Approach:
	- Dfs + Buttom up:
    - For each node, return (now, later)
    	- Now: use the current node value
    	- Later: not use the current node value
    - now = left[1]+right[1]+cur_node.val
    - later = max(left) + max(right)
- Boundary and results:
	- Not node: return (0, 0)
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)
