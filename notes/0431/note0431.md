# Leetcode [431. Encode N-ary Tree to Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-n-ary-tree-to-binary-tree/)
- Type: Binary tree
- Approach:
	1. The left child of a binary node is the subtree encoding all the children of the corresponding n-ary node.
	2. The right child of a binary node is a chain of the binary root nodes encoding each sibling of the n-ary node.
	3. Note that the root node has no siblings.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
