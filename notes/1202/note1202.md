# Leetcode [1202. Smallest String With Swaps](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-with-swaps/)
- Type: Graph (union find)
- Approach:
	- The two pairs in pairs array means the they are related and can swap each other. Thus, we can use union find method to union each pair in pairs array and store the parent node as the least alphabet character.
	- After building the union find graph, we use a dictionary to store the parents of each character in the s string and sort them as alphabet decrease so that we can pop the least alphabet character in a specific parent.
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(nlogn+V+E)
	- Space: O(n)
