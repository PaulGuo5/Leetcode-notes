# Leetcode [57. Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/)

- Type: Array (intervals)

- Approach:
	1. Approach 1:
		- Similar to the problem [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/).
		- Insert the new interval to the intervals by O(n) time, because intervals are sorted.
		- Then, solve the problem like problem 56.
	2. Approach 2:
		- Divide the intervals into 3 parts: left, overlap, right.
		- Left: end of all intervals is less than start of new interval.
		- Right: start of all intervals is larger than end of new interval.
		- Overlap: the rest of intervals are overlapping and set new start of interval as minimum of the start of overlapping intervals, and set new end of interval as maximum of the end of overlapping intervals.
		
- Complexity:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)
